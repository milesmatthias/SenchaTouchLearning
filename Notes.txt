Things I've Read, Tested, and Understand:
    - Ext.Application and options
    - load mask
    - profiles
    

Things I've read, but want to test:
    - Events and listeners (on, un, etc.)

Things I've Read about, but am still unsure about:
    - Event "bubbling" 



Other:
    - The LoadMask is a nice feature of SenchaTouch, but Safari already has the ability to use a startup image:
            <link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="/startup.png">
        However using the SenchaTouch way, you are guaranteed it to work on other platforms and you can customize the timing of it.
