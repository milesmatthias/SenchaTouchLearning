Things I've Read, Tested, and Understand:
    - Ext.Application and options
    - load mask
    - profiles
    

Things I've read, but want to test:
    - Events and listeners (on, un, etc.)

Things I've Read about, but am still unsure about:
    - Event "bubbling" 



Other:
    - The LoadMask is a nice feature of SenchaTouch, but Safari already has the ability to use a startup image:
            <link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="/startup.png">
        However using the SenchaTouch way, you are guaranteed it to work on other platforms and you can customize the timing of it.


Resources I'm looking at:
    - API Docs that come with the SDK
    - http://www.sencha.com/learn/touch/
    - https://github.com/senchalearn/teagrams


Sencha Touch Desired Improvements:
    - Abstract documentation and introduction.
        The vast majority of Sencha Touch documentation is made up of either tutorials or reference docs. Neither one of these are very useful when just trying to get introduced to the framework. Apple has great introductory documentation for iOS, describing the architecture, design pattern standards, coding pattern standards, and other standards. Sencha Touch has a ton of tutorials, that each do things a little differently, which makes the framework feel very hacked together.
    
    - More built-in functionality. 
        iOS is great at providing a ton of built-in functionality without the developer having to very much. Sencha Touch does have a lot of built in, but they're not on par with iOS yet. The main one I've run into is that CRUD isn't as baked in (like in lists).
