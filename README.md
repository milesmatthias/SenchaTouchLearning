Sencha Touch Learning
========================

This is just a playground environment where I can do some random tests with Sencha Touch while I'm learning it. I'm also using a text file to record how I'm going about learning it and what some of the results have been.

I'm using Node.js to serve up files, because JavaScript is awesome.
