Sencha Touch Learning
========================

This is just a playground environment where I can do some random tests with Sencha Touch while I'm learning it. I'm also using a text file to record how I'm going about learning it and what some of the results have been.

I'm using Node.js to serve up files, because JavaScript is awesome.

Also, even though Sencha Touch allows for these apps to be run on multiple platforms, I'm currently only optimizing them for iOS devices.
